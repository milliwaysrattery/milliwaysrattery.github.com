	<p>Milliways rattery is a new rattery based in Southampton, Hampshire. My name is Angela, and I&#39;ve been keeping rats for 3 years. I had a couple as a child, but have only got back into keeping these wonderful creatures recently. They are very much a large part of my life, and I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without them!</p>

	<p>I aim to breed happy, healthy rats suitable both for pet homes and showing. The variety I will be working on is Russian blue point Siamese (both red and black-eyed), as well as seal point Siamese. There will probably also be blacks, Russian blues with the odd agouti and dumbo. </p>

<h3>Caledonian Rattery</h3>

<p>I will be working in conjunction with Lois at <a href="http://www.caledonianrats.co.uk">Caledonian Rattery</a> with the breeding of this line. I will be keeping only bucks, and Lois mostly does. This will allow both  of us to minimise the number of rats we have, which in turn gives us more time to spend with each rat and each litter. Hopefully this will result in even more friendly rats! We plan to alternate where each litter is born, meaning one litter will be Milliways rats and the next Caledonian.</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>
	
	<p>If you are interested in homing kittens from me, please <a href="mailto:milliwaysrattery@gmail.com">email us</a>

	<p>I will send you an application form which I ask that you complete and return to me. This is simply to get an idea of how you plan to keep your rats, there are no trick questions and if you have any queries just ask!</p>
