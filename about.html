<h3>Breeding Aims</h3>
<p>I aim to breed happy, healthy rats that will make wonderful pets for many people. The wellbeing of my rats comes first, and I will only breed from rats I consider to have the type and personality that I wish to encourage. I will also only breed from rats from reputable breeders (whose ethics I agree with) and whose pedigree is known.</p>

<h3>Caledonian Rattery</h3>
<p>Lois at Caledonian rattery is the main reason behind me getting into breeding. The majority of my rats have been from her, and they are the most wonderful rats â€“ gorgeous, and also with the most amazing, friendly personalities! She gave me Bloo (Caledonian Blooregard Q. Kazoo), who has gained both NFRS Show, and Platinum championships, and sired a litter for her. He is a Russian blue point siamese, the inspiration, and the foundation rat, for me to start this rattery.</p>

<h3>Homing</h3>
<p>I will ask all potential kitten homes to fill out an application form, and if you home from me, to sign a contract. All kittens must be homed in at least pairs, unless there will be same aged company, and will not be ready until 6 weeks old at the earliest. Some kittens will take longer than this to mature, and I will not home them until I believe they are ready. If, in the event of you not being able to care for the rats any more, they must come back to me as first refusal.</p>

<h3>Varieties</h3>
<p>Below are examples of the varieties of rats which I will be breeding for:</p>
