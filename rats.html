<h3>Eddie</h3>
<p>Eddie was bred at Caledonian Rattery and was from the first litter sired by our Bloo, so we had to have him! He was a very friendly little kitten, and loved playing with his littermates and later on his much larger cagemates. However, when he reached 3 months he started to have fits. Epilepsy is very rare, though not unheard of, in rats and we started him on treatment. Unfortunately this didn&#39;t seem to help, and he died at just 16 weeks old. We now believe that he had a brain tumour which was causing the fits, not epilepsy. His death was very hard to take at such a young age.</p>
